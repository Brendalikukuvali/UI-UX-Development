<p>Chapter four the Chameleon is also one of the most in interesting chapters in the book. Trevor learned to use different languages just like his mother did and it became a tool that served him through his whole life. One day as he was walking down the street, a group of Zulu guys was walking behind him, closing in on him, and he could hear them talking to one another about how they were going to mug him.”Asibambe le autie yomlungu. Phuma ngapha mina ngizoqhamuka ngevuma kwake.”Meaning let’s get this white guy .You go to his left, and I’ll come up behind him. Trevor didn’t know what to do, he could run, so he just spun around real quick and said “Kodwa bafwethu yingani singavele sibambe umuntu inkunzi? Asenzeni.Mina ngikulindele.”Which meant that you guys why don’t we just mug someone together? Let’s do it. </p>
