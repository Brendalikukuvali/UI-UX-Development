<p> The first church offered jubilant praise of the Lord, the second church offered deep analysis of the scripture, which his mom loved and the third church offered passion and catharsis; it was a place where you truly felt the presence of the Holy Spirit inside you. During this movement back and forth Noah noticed that each church had its own distinct racial makeup: Jubilant church was a mixed church; that is the white people and the black people, Analytical church was white people’s church and finally Passionate cathartic church that was black people’s church. Noah enjoyed going to all the churches. He loved the white peoples church because he used not to go the main service and rather he could attend Sunday school where they got to read cool stories and his favorite was Noah and the flood because he had his personal stake there he also loved other stories like David slaying Goliath among others.</p>
